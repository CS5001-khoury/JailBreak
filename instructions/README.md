# Homework 04 - Escape from Jail

For this assignment, you will explore while loops in multiple ways, and expand upon your knowledge using functions. 

The premise for this assignment is inspired by the [Think Like a Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFVdHDMcepw&list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or&index=2)series Lessons by Alex Rosenthal, directed by Kozmonot Animation Studio. 




## Coding Practice
Looking at the coding [practice problems](https://github.com/CS5001-khoury/Resources/blob/main/PracticeProblems.md) in the class resources, you should ideally do a few
others on your own to get more practice coding.  However, you need to submit at least ONE (1) 
completed practice as its own python file (which means even if the coding practice had an online
form to fill out like codingbat, you need to copy your solution to a python file). 




## üìù Grading Rubric

You need to submit the following files:

* [jailbreak.py](../src/jailbreak.py)
* Your Coding Practice file
* [Report.md](../Report.md)
* [README.md](../README.md) (the one with your name in it)


### Rubric


1. Learning (AG)
   * check_x functions are completed properly
2. Approaching  (AG)
   * rgb_to_hex_x functions completed properly
   * get_fails completed properly
   * passes PEP8 style check
3. Meets  (MG)
   * Used loops to generate the pattern.
   * Properly formatted docstrings exist for each function
   * Coding practice file provided
4. Exceeds  (MG)
   * Report questions answered properly
   * Report deeper thinking answered with some thought


AG - Auto-graded  
MG - Manually graded



### Submission Reminder üö®
For manually graded elements, we only guarantee time to submit for a regrade IF you submit by the DUE DATE. Submitting late may mean it isn't possible for the MG to be graded before the AVAILABLE BY DATE, removing any windows for your to resubmit in time. While it will be graded, it is always best to submit by the due date, so you have full opportunity to improve your grade.
